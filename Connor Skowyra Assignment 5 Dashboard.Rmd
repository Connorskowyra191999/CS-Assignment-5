## Running Simulated Plot

```{r}
emissions_df <- tibble(
Year = 2015:2022,
Total_Emissions_MtCO2e = c(1550, 1520, 1505, 1480, 1450, 1410, 1380, 1350)
)
```

```{r}
ggplot(emissions_df, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Emissions_MtCO2e)) +
geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
geom_point(size = 3) +
labs(
title = "Total Transportation Emissions by Year",
x = "Year",
y = "Emissions (Million metric tons CO₂e)"
) +

# Couple Notes

This project was completed in 2022 and I was not able to obtain the original data for this study as the website did not give me any data so this data is simulated. This line chart displays a decrease in annual emissions from 2015 to 2022.
